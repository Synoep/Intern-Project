# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document provides an overview of the CI/CD pipeline implementation for our containerized web application.

## Pipeline Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following key components:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)** - Triggered on all branches
2. **Continuous Deployment to Staging (CD)** - Automatically triggered on the `develop` branch
3. **Continuous Deployment to Production (CD)** - Manually triggered or automatically on the `main` branch

## Pipeline Stages

### CI Pipeline (All Branches)

The CI pipeline runs on all branches and includes the following stages:

1. **Linting** - Checks code quality and style conformance
2. **Testing** - Runs unit and integration tests
3. **Build** - Builds the Docker container and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry
4. **Security Scan** - Scans for vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies

### CD Pipeline (Staging)

The CD pipeline to staging runs automatically on pushes to the `develop` branch:

1. **Deploy to Staging** - Deploys the application to the Kubernetes staging environment
2. **Verify Deployment** - Ensures the deployment was successful
3. **Smoke Tests** - Runs basic tests to verify functionality
4. **Notification** - Notifies the team of the deployment status

### CD Pipeline (Production)

The CD pipeline to production can be triggered manually or automatically on pushes to the `main` branch:

1. **Deploy to Production** - Deploys the application to the Kubernetes production environment
2. **Verify Deployment** - Ensures the deployment was successful
3. **Monitor Deployment** - Monitors the health of the deployment for a set period
4. **Notification** - Notifies the team of the deployment status
5. **Rollback** - Automatically rolls back if the deployment fails

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check the build logs for specific error messages
   - Verify that all dependencies are correctly specified
   - Ensure the Dockerfile is valid and all required files are included

2. **Test Failures**
   - Review test logs to identify the failing tests
   - Check if environment-specific configurations are correct
   - Verify that mock services or dependencies are available

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check Kubernetes logs: `kubectl logs -n <namespace> deployment/<deployment-name>`
   - Verify that the container image exists and is accessible
   - Check for resource constraints or quota issues
   - Inspect the pod status: `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`

4. **Security Scan Failures**
   - Review the security scan results to identify vulnerabilities
   - Update dependencies to address security issues
   - Add exceptions for false positives (with caution)

5. **Infrastructure Issues**
   - Verify AWS/Cloud credentials and permissions
   - Check the health of the Kubernetes cluster
   - Review network policies and security groups

### Monitoring and Debugging

1. **View Pipeline Logs**
   - Navigate to GitHub Actions tab in the repository
   - Select the workflow run to view detailed logs

2. **Check Deployment Status**
   - Use `kubectl` to check deployment status:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name> -n <namespace>
     ```

3. **Access Application Logs**
   - View container logs:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -f -n <namespace> deployment/<deployment-name>
     ```

4. **Debug Network Issues**
   - Verify service connectivity:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it -n <namespace> <pod-name> -- curl -v <service-url>
     ```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Use feature branches for all changes
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Keep commits small and focused

2. **Testing**
   - Write comprehensive tests covering key functionality
   - Include both unit and integration tests
   - Test with production-like data and conditions

3. **Security**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Scan for vulnerabilities frequently
   - Use secrets management for sensitive information

4. **Monitoring**
   - Implement application and infrastructure monitoring
   - Set up alerts for critical issues
   - Regularly review logs and metrics

5. **Documentation**
   - Keep pipeline documentation updated
   - Document troubleshooting steps for common issues
   - Include runbooks for emergency situations

## Environment Setup

### Required Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured in GitHub:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key for EKS cluster access
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret key for EKS cluster access
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region where the EKS cluster is located
- `EKS_CLUSTER_NAME` - Name of the EKS cluster
- `SNYK_TOKEN` - API token for Snyk vulnerability scanning

### Required Permissions

- GitHub workflow permissions to push to GitHub Container Registry
- AWS IAM permissions to access and modify EKS resources
- Kubernetes RBAC permissions for deployment management
